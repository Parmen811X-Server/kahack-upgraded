# kahack-upgraded
we have used the original Kahack script and changed it a little to make it better(so far from now on you can press ALT+W to answer so its stealthy(the"TESTnewkahack" is experiment but works it adds ALT+S to show the naswers so the class can see it on your device or something)) all credit goes to: jokeri2222
